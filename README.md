## Rationale

**TL;DR** paeckchen is an incremental, fast and efficient JavaScript module bundler [doing one thing well](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy#Do_One_Thing_and_Do_It_Well).

Most JavaScript module bundlers do a lot of things â€“ being plugin pipelines, fulfilling development setup wishes, being development servers and so on. This breadth of features inevitably comes with tradeoffs.

paeckchen on the other hand is designed to do exactly one thing: It bundles your JavaScript modules. This focus allows paeckchen to do its job fast and efficiently.
