# bundling es2015 modules

This examples showing the usage of paeckchen if your sources are written as es2015 modules.

Start with

```shell
npm install
npm start
```

Afterwards open the index.html in your browser and have a look at the browser console.

Note: Right now this does not work in node.js, because paeckchen does support only browsers as
[target runtime](https://github.com/paeckchen/paeckchen/issues/68).
